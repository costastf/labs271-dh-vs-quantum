    "## Shor's Algorithm\n",

    "Shor's algorithm is used to find prime factors of an integer. On a quantum computer, Shor's algorithm runs in polynomial time and is almost exponentially faster than the most efficient known classical factoring algorithm. The efficiency of Shor's algorithm is due to the efficiency of the Quantum Fourier transform, Quantum Phase estimation and modular exponentiation by repeated squarings. In this notebook, you implement the Shor's algorithm in code using the Amazon Braket SDK and run a simple example of factoring 15.\n",
